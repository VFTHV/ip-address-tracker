## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

- Apply JavaScript functionality to appropriate parts of the interface
- Refactor the code

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Asynchronous fetch() API

### What I learned

- LeafLet Map API
- Got better at using multiple API's in a single project
- Added to my knowledge of fetch() JavaScript API promises
- Extended my proficiency at responsive CSS

### Continued development

- I'd like to advance my skills at API POST, PUT & DELETE requests

### Useful resources
